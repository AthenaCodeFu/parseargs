# Command Line Arguments

## Problem Description

Most of us have had to parse command-line arguments from time to time. If we
don't have a convenient utility, then we simply walk the array of strings that
is passed into the main function. There are several good utilities available
from various sources, but they probably don't do exactly what we want. So letâ€™s
write another one! 

The arguments passed to the program consist of flags and values. Flags should
be one character, preceded by a minus sign. Each flag should have zero, or one
value associated with it. You should write a parser for this kind of arguments.
This parser takes a schema detailing what arguments the program expects. The
schema specifies the number and types of flags and values the program expects.
Once the schema has been specified, the program should pass the actual argument
list to the args parser. It will verify that the arguments match the schema.
The program can then ask the args parser for each of the values, using the
names of the flags. The values are returned with the correct types, as
specified in the schema. 

For example if the program is to be called with these arguments: 

    -l -p 8080 -d /usr/logs

this indicates a schema with 3 flags: `l`, `p`, `d`. The `l` (logging) flag has
no values associated with it, it is a boolean flag: _True_ if present, _False_
if not. Phe `p` (port) flag has an integer value, and the `d` (directory) flag
has a string value. 

If a flag mentioned in the schema is missing in the arguments, a suitable
default value should be returned. For example "False" for a boolean, 0 for a
number, and "" for a string. If the arguments given do not match the schema, it
is important that a good error message is given, explaining exactly what is
wrong.

If you are feeling ambitious, extend your code to support lists, e.g.:

    -g this,is,a,list -d 1,2,-3,5

So the `g` flag indicates a list of strings, `["this", "is", "a", "list"]` and
the `d` flag indicates a list of integers, `[1, 2, -3, 5]`.

Make sure your code is extensible, in that it is straightforward and obvious
how to add new types of values. 

## Current Features

* single-character flags
* numeric/string/boolean flag types
* default values for unspecified flags

## Missing Features

* list types (this is partially implemented)
* validation for numeric values

## Usage Example

From the unit test file:

	my $parser = ParseArgs->new({l => 'bool', p => 'num', d => 'str', -x => 'bool'});
	$parser->Parse(@ARGV);
	
	# assuming the command line contained "script_name -l -p 8080 -d /usr/logs":
	$parser->Get('l');  # => 1
	$parser->Get('p');  # => 8080
	$parser->Get('d');  # => '/usr/logs'
	$parser->Get('x');  # => false value (because the command line didn't contain -x)
